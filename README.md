# Nature-In-Purgatory
Creating the microscopic endemic tissue images by General Adversarial Network trained with dead and alive samples 

### General Info:<br> 
Welcome to our Generative AI project which the outputs were on display for a modern art exhibition of Culture Civic.<br><br>We collected 10000 microscopic tissue images after a huge forest fire that 405 hectares of forest lands burnt in MuÄŸla (a beautiful city in the Mediterranean region of Turkey). We wanted AI to generate the purgatory state of nature with models trained on the equally biased dataset consisting of both alive and dead tissue images.<br>The first step of our work was building a basic GAN architecture using Pytorch which is shared within the repository.<br><br><br>You can contact us via e-mail to retrieve the Google Drive link of the binary data file of the latest trained model to by-pass the training step and directly generating images. You only need to import the "generator.h5" by providing the downloaded file path and run the "temp.py".
